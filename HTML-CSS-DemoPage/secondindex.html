					<h2>Cake Facts</h2>

				<hr/>

				<h3> Picture of a cake </h3>
				<p>
					I was given a picture of a cake to work with, so I guess I'm talking about cakes.
					<br/>
					<em>Here's a picture of a cake. It's sized using relative size and everything.</em> 
					<br/>
					<strong>It even links to the Wikipedia page.</strong> 
					<br/>
					<span class="fineprint">okay, no, it doesn't</span>
				</p>

				</a>

				<hr />

				<h3> Quick notes </h3>
				<p>
					If you're not a fan of Wikipedia, here's some cake facts to get you started:
					<ul>
						<li> There's a lot of types of cake. </li>
						<li> Cakes are usually baked in an oven of some kind. </li>
						<li> They're a good source of sugar, if nothing else. </li>
						<li> Some people manage to make cakes without baking, apparently. </li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<hr />

				<h3>Cake-related deduction</h3>
				<p>
					You can make some deductions about a cake based on whether it's baked or not, and whether it was in an oven at some point.
				</p>
				
				<!-- Table of cake states - need to find more compact layout for table markup! -->
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>
						</td>
						<td>
							<strong>Oven</strong>
						</td>
						<td>
							<strong>Not-Oven</strong>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Baked</strong>
						</td>
						<td>
							Most cakes fall under this category
						</td>
						<td>
							Likely cooked in a car in the afternoon sun
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Not-Baked</strong>
						</td>
						<td>
							Did you remember to turn the oven on
						</td>
						<td>
							Well, some people like eating cake dough
						</td>
					</tr>
