					Oh well.

					Instead of that, all I have to offer is a silly website in which I talk about nothing in particular.

					<h3> Picture of a cake </h3>
					<p>
						I was given a picture of a cake to work with, so I guess I'm talking about cakes.
					</p>

						<em>Here's a picture of a cake. It's sized using relative size and everything.</em>

					<h3> Quick notes </h3>
					<p>
						If you're not a fan of Wikipedia, here's some cake facts to get you started:
						<ul>
							<li> There's a lot of types of cake. </li>
							<li> Cakes are usually baked in an oven of some kind. </li>
							<li> They're a good source of sugar, if nothing else. </li>
							<li> Some people manage to make cakes without baking, apparently. </li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="spaced-section flex-container-vertical">
					<h3>Cake-related deduction</h3>
					<p>
						You can make some deductions about a cake based on whether it's baked or not, and whether it was in an oven at some point.
					</p>
					
					<!-- Table of cake states - need to find more compact layout for table markup! -->
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th> </th>
							<th> Oven </th>
							<th> Not-Oven </th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th> Baked </th>
							<td> Most cakes fall under this category </td>
							<td> Likely cooked in a car in the afternoon sun </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th> Not-Baked </th>
							<td> Did you remember to turn the oven on </td>
							<td> Well, some people like eating cake dough </td>
						</tr>
					</table>
